<conditions>
- Creating files needed to complete the authorized task
- Replacing entire file contents when editing would be more complex
- Supports `.zip` (and ZIP-based `.jar`/`.war`/`.ear`/`.apk`), `.tar`, `.tar.gz`/`.tgz`, `.tar.zst`, and `.asar` archive entries via `archive.ext:path/inside/archive`; other archive formats (`.rar`, `.7z`, `.iso`, …) are read-only
- Supports SQLite row operations via `db.sqlite:table` (insert), `db.sqlite:table:key` (update with JSON content, delete with empty content)
</conditions>

<critical>
- You SHOULD use Edit tool for modifying existing files
- Create project documentation only when the user or applicable project/workflow instructions explicitly require it. Required `local://` planning artifacts are not unsolicited project documentation.
